├── When there is enough demand exactly at and above the tick
│   ├── it should set clearing price to a tick boundary

├── When there is enough demand at the tick and ticks above but not enough demand at ticks above to find a clearing price inbetween
│   ├── it should set clearing price to a tick boundary
│   └── it should set sumDemandAboveClearing to be sum of ticks above clearing price
├── When there is enough demand at the ticks above to find a clearing price between tick boundaries
│   ├── it should find clearing price between tick boundaries

└── When there is enough demand to fall below the next tick but rounds up to the next tick
    ├── it should find clearing price at next tick boundary
    ├── it should find clearing price rounded down falls below tick boundary
    ├── it should find demand at next tick < currency raised at clearing price
